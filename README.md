# Cloud Explorer: A React Native Cloud Learning Application

## Overview

Cloud Explorer is a mobile application built with React Native designed to provide an interactive and fun way to learn about cloud computing concepts. This application is built with a component-based architecture, mirroring Angular's modularity, making it easy to understand and extend.

## Target Audience

This application is for:

- Individuals new to cloud computing.
- Students studying cloud technologies.
- Developers looking to reinforce their understanding of cloud concepts.
- Anyone curious about how the cloud works in a practical context.

## Core Features

- **Home/Landing Page:** An engaging starting point with introductory information and navigation options.
- **Cloud Concept Modules:** Separate modules for topics such as:
  - Cloud Service Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
  - Cloud Deployment Models (Public, Private, Hybrid)
  - Core Cloud Services (Compute, Storage, Database)
  - Cloud Security
- **Interactive Components:** Use of quizzes, diagrams, and examples to illustrate concepts.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Built using React Native, ensuring the application works seamlessly on both iOS and Android devices.

## Technical Architecture

- **React Native:** The core framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** The application is broken down into reusable UI components.
- **Navigation:** React Navigation or a similar library for handling app navigation.
- **Styling:** Using React Native's built-in styling capabilities or styled-components/tailwind.
- **State Management:** Basic React state management for simpler scenarios, using context API if necessary for more complex cases.
- **UI Library:** We will utilize react-native-paper for UI elements
